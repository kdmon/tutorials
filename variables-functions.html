      /* Defining variables
      
        A variable is a name that holds a value.
        
        In javascript we declare variables with the keyword 'var',
        for example: 
        
      */
      
      var name = "karl";
    
      // This creates a variable called name, which is set to karl.
     
      /* Variable types
        
        1. String (text) 
        
        The double quotes surrounding Ferrari are important to define 
        a variable as a text (called string).
      
      */
        
      var carMake = "Ferrari";
      
      /* 2.Numbers
      
      We can also have variables that store numbers, such as:
      
      */
      
      var months = 12;
      
      /* This is called an integer variable.
      
      Notice, we don't have double quotes. 
         
      We can of course also define fractions:
      
      */
      
      var PI = 3.14;
      
      
      /* Boolean (true or false) variables
      
        This is a special type that is used to store 
        a program's 'state', e.g.:
        
        Lights are on or off.
        User has answered yes or no.
        Binary number is one or zero.
        
        For example:
        
      */
      
      var raining = false; //It is not raining (right now).
      var sunny = true; // It is sunny (right now).
      
      
      /* Conditions -- the if/else statements
      
      This is how you define logic in javascript,
      and many other programming languages.
      
      For example, we might take different actions 
      depending on the weather:
      
      if (sunny && !raining) { ... }
      
      This reads, if it is sunny and not raining, do something {...};
      
      The double ampersands means "and".
      The exclamation mark means negation (not).
      The thing within squiggly brackets is the code that will run if the condition is met. 

      You can also chain condition statements together: 
      
      */
      
      if (sunny) {
        alert("Wear Sun Screen");
      } else if (raining) {
        alert("Wear Sun Screen");
      } else {
        var overcast = true;
      }
      
      /* These conditional statements goes through three tests
         only executes one of the three options.
         
         Two first options (wear sunscreen and bring umbrella) are
         calling the alert function to create a pop up notification
         
      */
     
     
      /* Functions

        Functions are an extremely useful feature of javascript.
        
        They allow you to define chunks of code that can be
        executed repeatedly -- building blocks.
        
        For example, here is a simple function that brings
        up a dialogue box: 
      
      */
      
      
      function alertUser(message) {
        alert(message);
      }
      
      
      /* This reads: alertUser is a function that
         takes one parameter (input): 'message'.
        
        We can call the function directly from a HTML hyperlink by
        assigning the href with javascript: followed by the name of the function:
        
        
        <a href="javascript: alertUser('Hello there')">Say hello</a>
        <a href="javascript: alertUser('See you later')">Say goodbye</a>
        
        Notice that in this example we execute the same function (alertUser)
        But we pass in different parameters, so the behaviour of the function changes.
        i.e. it gives a different message.
